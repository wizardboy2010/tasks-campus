    "#### This particular assignment focuses on text classification using CNN. It has been picking up pace over the past few years. So, I thought this would be a good exercise to try out. The dataset is provided to you and there will be specific instrucions on how to curate the data, split into train and validation and the like.  You will be using MXnet for this task.  The data comprises tweets pertaining to common causes of cancer. The objective is to classify the tweets as medically relevant or not.  The dataset is skewed with positive class or 'yes' being 6 times less frequent than the negative class or 'no'. (Total marks = 50). Individual marks to the sub-problems are given in bracket. "
